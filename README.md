# Find Your Hat Game

Cool game from the Full-Stack career path in Codecademy. It uses javascript to create the game. I had a hard time creating the code from scratch so I used help from the community forums; therefore, credit goes to codecademy and its team for the help. I save it here so that I can come back and look at it. 

Enjoy!
